 Fishnet
=========

The idea is a very lose network of computers.

Each will be able to be:

an open wifi network, FISHNET

data sensors and data providers.

clocks

locations

Networking
==========

Many nodes will not have access to networks beyond their own wifi
network.

If other nodes connect, they can share data.

They can inform each other what data seems to be of interest at that
location or time.

Nodes can choose what they want to share, but should keep in mind that
any data is accessible by others connecting to the network.

A node need not share its data, but the same caveat applies, that it
is data on a computer, it is not encrypted.

All data is open to interpretation.

Raspberrry Pi
=============

This series of devices are wonderful machines to experiment with.  I
am reminded of lego, but this time with computers.

The pi's themselves are very capable computers.  Further, storage is
getting cheap, around $1 per 1GB.  With fast transfers of data.

The memory is large enough for some complex calculations.

And then there is the GPU

Sense Hat
=========

The Astro Pi or Sense Hat is an amazing little addition to a pi.

It is around $40, but comes with an 8*8 pixel screen that can be used
to display information.

There is also a joy-stick and an array of sensors.

Python
======

There is an excellent python library for the sense-hat.

On raspian, just:

  apt-get install sense-hat

  

Jupyter
=======

Project Jupyter is a key hub around which a number of wonderful tools
are being integrated:

   pandas, numpy, scipy, sckit-learn, ipython, ...
